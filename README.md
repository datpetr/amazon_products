This project is based on the research of Amazonâ€™s sales
information. The dataset contained multiple continuous and categorical
variables that needed to be cleaned and organized in order to be used in the visualizations. 
We prepared 10 questions about 6 graphs of the sales in order to explore possible correlations 
and trends of various variables. Below, we will provide details of data, data cleaning, data exploration, 
and descriptive statistics. Afterward, we will use all of those to present visualizations and Exploratory 
Data Analysis to answer the questions about the data.

if you want to open data_cleaning.iypb do it throw google collab. You should also put the Amazon.xlsx in directory /data/original/ and crete /data/filtered/
